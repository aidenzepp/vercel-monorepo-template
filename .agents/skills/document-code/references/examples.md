# Code Documentation Examples

Use these examples as labeled acceptance data. The text immediately above each snippet states the evidence that determines its label.

## Props, callbacks, and components

### NEGATIVE — Polished restatement leaves the contract undocumented

**Decisive evidence:** The interface and property comments merely repeat their names. The component repeats TypeScript types, omits the destructured property tag, calls its result “JSX,” and adds an `@see` link that conveys nothing beyond the signature.

```tsx
/** Profile name input props. */
interface ProfileNameInputProps {
  /** The placeholder. */
  placeholder?: string;
}

/**
 * The ProfileNameInput component.
 *
 * @param {ProfileNameInputProps} props - The props.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The JSX element.
 * @see {@link ProfileNameInputProps}
 */
const ProfileNameInput = ({ placeholder }: ProfileNameInputProps) => (
  <Input placeholder={placeholder} />
);
```

### POSITIVE — The component owns its local props contract

**Decisive evidence:** The local props interface stays structural. The component is the public behavior a reader needs to understand, so its tags own the object and property meanings without a second copy on the interface.

```tsx
interface ProfileNameInputProps {
  placeholder?: string;
}

/**
 * Displays the name control registered by the surrounding profile form.
 *
 * @param props - The presentation values for the name field.
 * @param props.placeholder - Supplies the control's empty-state hint.
 * @returns The editable name field used by profile settings.
 */
const ProfileNameInput = ({ placeholder }: ProfileNameInputProps) => (
  <Input name="name" placeholder={placeholder} />
);
```

### POSITIVE — A component owns its callback prop contract

**Decisive evidence:** The local props interface remains structural. The component comment explains the callback at the point where callers choose to provide it, including what promise completion guarantees.

```tsx
interface ProfileSettingsFormProps {
  user: Pick<User, "name" | "username">;
  onSave: (profile: ProfileSettings) => Promise<void>;
}

/**
 * Displays editable public identity fields and submits validated changes.
 *
 * @param props - The values and persistence capability for profile settings.
 * @param props.user - Supplies the current public identity shown by the fields.
 * @param props.onSave - Persists the validated identity and resolves once the saved values are observable.
 * @returns The form used to edit a user's public identity.
 */
const ProfileSettingsForm = ({ user, onSave }: ProfileSettingsFormProps) => {
  // ...
};
```

### POSITIVE — A standalone interface owns its reusable boundary

**Decisive evidence:** This interface is consumed independently of one component. Its comment defines the service boundary, while the method comment records the non-obvious completion guarantee once for every caller.

```ts
/**
 * The persistence operations available for a user's public profile.
 */
interface ProfileRepository {
  /**
   * Persists a validated public identity.
   *
   * @param userId - The user whose public identity is changing.
   * @param profile - The validated name and username to persist.
   * @returns A promise that resolves once later reads can observe the saved values.
   */
  save(userId: string, profile: ProfileSettings): Promise<void>;
}
```

## File-local helpers and module constants

### NEGATIVE — Documentation decorates names without adding a contract

**Decisive evidence:** These comments only turn identifiers into sentences. They do not state which layers share the limit or what normalization guarantees.

```ts
/** The maximum username length. */
const MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH = 32;

/** Normalizes a username. */
const normalizeUsername = (value: string) => value.trim().toLowerCase();
```

### POSITIVE — Concise comments explain system role and guarantee

**Decisive evidence:** The constant identifies the consumers that must agree. The helper documents its input meaning and exact semantic result without optional tag filler.

```ts
/**
 * The largest username accepted by both form validation and Better Auth.
 */
const MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH = 32;

/**
 * Converts a user-entered username to its comparison form.
 *
 * @param value - The username exactly as entered by the user.
 * @returns The trimmed, lowercase username used for validation and uniqueness.
 */
const normalizeUsername = (value: string) => value.trim().toLowerCase();
```

## Overload sets

### NEGATIVE — Shared boilerplate obscures distinct overload contracts

**Decisive evidence:** The overload comments do not distinguish accepted formats or results, while the implementation signature receives a third redundant comment.

```ts
/** Parses a profile. */
export function parseProfile(value: string): Profile;

/** Parses a profile. */
export function parseProfile(value: URLSearchParams): Partial<Profile>;

/** Parses a profile. */
export function parseProfile(
  value: string | URLSearchParams
): Profile | Partial<Profile> {
  // ...
}
```

### POSITIVE — Each public overload owns its differing contract

**Decisive evidence:** Each public signature documents its own input format, result guarantee, and escaping failure. The implementation signature has no separate comment because it is not another public contract.

```ts
/**
 * Parses a complete profile from its compact serialized representation.
 *
 * @param value - A pipe-delimited display name and username.
 * @returns The complete profile with a normalized username.
 * @throws {RangeError} When either required field is absent.
 */
export function parseProfile(value: string): Profile;

/**
 * Parses the profile fields present in submitted search parameters.
 *
 * @param value - Parameters containing optional name and username fields.
 * @returns The non-empty submitted fields with a normalized username.
 */
export function parseProfile(value: URLSearchParams): Partial<Profile>;

export function parseProfile(
  value: string | URLSearchParams
): Profile | Partial<Profile> {
  // ...
}
```

## Optional tags

### NEGATIVE — Optional tags are present only to look complete

**Decisive evidence:** The relationship is already obvious from the parameter type, the usage is ordinary, and no error escapes. These tags add no navigation or contract information.

```ts
/**
 * Displays the user menu.
 *
 * @param props - The menu values.
 * @returns The user menu.
 * @see {@link UserMenuProps}
 * @example
 * <UserMenu user={user} />
 * @throws Never.
 */
const UserMenu = (props: UserMenuProps) => null;
```

### POSITIVE — Optional tags appear only where they change understanding

**Decisive evidence:** The link identifies the client-side counterpart that receives this server-validated value. Ordinary usage needs no example tag, and redirecting an unauthenticated request is described as control flow rather than a fictional thrown error.

```ts
/**
 * Returns the authenticated session required by a protected server boundary.
 *
 * Unauthenticated requests transfer control to the sign-in page.
 *
 * @returns The non-null session exposed to the protected subtree.
 * @see {@link SessionProvider}
 */
const requireSession = async (): Promise<Session> => {
  // ...
};
```

## Authoritative source links

### NEGATIVE — A generic homepage does not explain the sourced behavior

**Decisive evidence:** The comment claims an upstream-owned error catalog but links only to a homepage. A reader still has to rediscover the relevant documentation and cannot verify which source version the local values mirror.

```ts
/**
 * Better Auth redirect error codes.
 *
 * @see https://better-auth.com
 */
const redirectErrorCodeSchema = z.enum(["account_not_linked"]);
```

### POSITIVE — Documentation and versioned source make provenance verifiable

**Decisive evidence:** The canonical documentation explains the supported public behavior. The versioned source permalink proves the exact emitted value mirrored by this repository.

```ts
/**
 * Validates the redirect error codes owned by the installed Better Auth version.
 *
 * @see https://better-auth.com/docs/reference/errors
 * @see https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/blob/v1.7.2/packages/better-auth/src/oauth2/errors.ts
 */
const redirectErrorCodeSchema = z.enum(["account_not_linked"]);
```

## Comment format

### NEGATIVE — A one-line JSDoc block hides the normal documentation shape

**Decisive evidence:** Even a correct sentence uses the forbidden compact form, making comments visually inconsistent and leaving no natural place for future tags.

```ts
/** The largest username accepted by the authentication boundary. */
const MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH = 32;
```

### POSITIVE — Every JSDoc block uses the multiline form

**Decisive evidence:** The block follows the same stable shape whether it contains one sentence or several tags.

```ts
/**
 * The largest username accepted by the authentication boundary.
 */
const MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH = 32;
```
