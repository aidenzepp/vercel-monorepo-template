# Conventional Commits

Use this skill when preparing commits.

The goal is a commit history that reads like a small design document. Each commit should be targeted, reviewable, and meaningful on its own. A commit does not need to be large; it needs to represent one coherent reason for change.

## Commit Prefixes

Use these prefixes as the default vocabulary:

- `feat:` for new product behavior, new developer-facing capability, or new reusable API surface
- `fix:` for correctness fixes, regressions, crashes, broken workflows, or user-visible bugs
- `refactor:` for behavior-preserving structure, naming, boundary, or API reshaping
- `chore:` for repository maintenance, dependency updates, generated metadata, tooling, config, or cleanup
- `test:` for test-only changes or reusable test infrastructure
- `docs:` for documentation-only changes
- `style:` for presentation-only UI/CSS changes that do not alter behavior
- `perf:` for measurable performance work
- `build:` for package manager, bundler, compiler, or artifact pipeline changes
- `ci:` for CI workflow changes
- `revert:` for explicit reversions

Prefer the most specific truthful prefix. Avoid vague subjects such as `update`, `cleanup`, `misc`, or `changes`.

Optional scopes are fine when they clarify the boundary (`feat(api):`, `chore(lint):`). Do not invent noisy scopes.

## Split Commits By Story

Before staging, inspect the whole change:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Then split by story boundary:

- separate unrelated concerns, even when they touched nearby files
- separate tooling/config/dependency changes from product or library behavior
- separate reusable API additions from their first usage when each is independently meaningful
- keep tests with the behavior when the tests are the proof for that behavior
- split reusable test infrastructure into its own `test:` commit when it supports later commits
- keep mechanical formatting separate only when it would obscure the semantic diff
- exclude demos, scratch files, generated churn, and local experiments unless the user explicitly wants them kept

A clean DAG is not the same as many tiny commits. Do not split a change into commits that only make sense after reading future commits unless you are intentionally telling a migration story.

## Stage Carefully

Stage by path or hunk so the index matches the intended story:

```bash
git add path/to/file
git add -p
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

Avoid `git add .` unless the working tree has already been inspected and every changed file belongs in the same commit.

## Write The Message

Use an imperative, concise subject:

```text
feat: add async boundary component
chore: remove eslint config package
fix: ignore generated ui components
```

Add a body only when the commit needs context that is not obvious from the diff:

- why this boundary exists
- what was deliberately excluded
- what migration or compatibility trade-off was chosen
- what verification proves the change

## Verify The Boundary

Before committing, run the narrowest useful checks for the staged story. Prefer the repo's normal hygiene commands when relevant (format, lint, typecheck, test).

If a check is skipped, say why in the handoff. If a commit is intentionally not green on its own because it is part of a local migration sequence, make that explicit before committing.

## Final Pass

Before reporting completion:

- confirm `git status --short`
- confirm the new log tells the story in order
- report the commit hashes and the checks that ran
- do not push unless the user confirms the remote target
